# csvTool
Removes Markup from Text Documents

<p>csvTool was initially created in C#.NET to quickly revise (extremely dated) imported eBay listings in a Shopify store. Its purpose is primarily 
to remove invalid and outdated markup from large (~13,500 product listings) CSV files.</p>

  Usage: csvTool.exe [PATH TO DEFINITIONS] [PATH TO WORKING FILE] [PATH TO EXPORT FILE]<br>
  Example: csvTool.exe C:\definitions.txt C:\products.csv C:\products_revised.csv
  
  <p>Definitions files are semicolon-delimited.</p>
